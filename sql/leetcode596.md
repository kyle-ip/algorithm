#### [Classes More Than 5 Students](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/classes-more-than-5-students/)

SQL架构

```sql
Create table If Not Exists courses (student varchar(255), class varchar(255))
Truncate table courses
insert into courses (student, class) values ('A', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('B', 'English')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('C', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('D', 'Biology')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('E', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('F', 'Computer')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('G', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('H', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('I', 'Math')
```

There is a table `courses` with columns: **student** and **class**

Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.

For example, the table:

```
+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
```

Should output:

```
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
```

**Note:**
The students should not be counted duplicate in each course.
